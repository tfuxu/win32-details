## Building from source
### Prerequisites
The following packages are required to build win32-details:

* **Python** >= 3.6,
* A recent version of **Nautilus >= 43.x**,
* [nautilus-python](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NautilusPython),
* Copy of [exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool) (required by PyExifTool),
* [PyExifTool](https://pypi.org/project/PyExifTool/)
* **Meson** and **Ninja** build systems (only needed for [Using Meson](#using-meson) build option)

Required Python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build instructions
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tfuxu/win32-details.git
cd win32-details
```

#### As a library:
Local installation:
```
pip3 install --user .
win32-details --install-user
```

System-wide installation:
```
sudo pip3 install .
sudo win32-details --install-system

> If you get a `Directory already configured` message when running `meson builddir` command, you can append to this command `--wipe` option to clean build directory before configuration.

Close currently opened Nautilus instances to load the extension:
```
nautilus -q
```

## Note about Nautilus versions below 43.x
Support for older Nautilus versions has been removed in win32-details 0.5.0, because of moving to Nautilus API 4.0, which deprecates direct usage of GTK widgets in favor of a new model-based interface (which is a shitty decision IMO). In this situation I had three options:
- Maintain both versions of extension, one for Nautilus 43 and above, and one for Nautilus <= 42,
- Make this extension as a standalone program, and use extension to launch it,
- Just deprecate support for older Nautilus versions.

Honestly, I'm not that interested in maintaining a separate version of extension, as majority of people are using the latest version of Nautilus now. Moving a extension to a standalone program would make everything more complicated, and I don't think that many people would want to install an app which just shows them details of EXE files (but maybe, in the [future](https://github.com/tfuxu/win32-details/issues/5)...).
